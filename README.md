====================================

Local development
------------------
Run this locally via a server that runs php for simplist workflow.
e.g. if php 5.4+ installed you could use:
```
php -S localhost:8000
```
But apache, nginx or any web server that runs php would work.

Production
------------
Take the example-page.html contents and paste into the page this app will be use on.
Next do the same for the extra.js into the template/script/extra.js file.
And again the same for the pages_custom.css, except just add to the end of the template/style/pages_custom.css file.
Then upload the files and directories in the userfiles directory.
